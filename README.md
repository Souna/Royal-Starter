# Royals Pinger
Kinda improved server pinger from the other one I have. I like this one better, although this one is designed to ping a specific MapleStory private server.

- Pings the MapleRoyals login and game servers (whichever you choose)

- Has variable ping delays - can even go as low as 1 second

- Auto launches when the game is up! Get them FM spots!!

- Lets you choose a .mp3 file to play upon game server response
